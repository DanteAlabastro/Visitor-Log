# Visitor-Log
I want to create a publicly view able and write able Visitors Log saved onto the blockchain. It will store a message, the time written, and the senders address. This contract has been imported from my public gist at [gist.github.com/DanteAlabastro](https://gist.github.com/DanteAlabastro/5cdc6868a31f84dc960bdf1fe06af179).

The plan is to have an interface to this contract available on my personal website for friends and family to interact with. I see it as a fun way for me to share about the blockchain and Ethereum while allowing them to familiarize themselves with interacting with distrubted apps in a comfortable setting. My idea is to publish the contract onto the Ropsten Test Network to allow for interactions to be free. By design, reading the Visitor Log is already free.

## Try it out!
